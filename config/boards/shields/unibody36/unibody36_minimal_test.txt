MINIMAL TEST CONFIGURATION
=========================

Try commenting out some column pins to see if one is causing boot failure.

Suspect pins that might conflict with nice!nano:
- P0.06 (battery voltage divider)
- P1.00 (might be used for other functions)

To test:
1. Try removing P0.06 from col-gpios temporarily
2. See if keyboard boots and shows up in Bluetooth
3. If it boots, we know P0.06 is the problem and need to rewire that column

Alternative approach:
Flash a completely stock ZMK firmware to verify nice!nano hardware is working.
